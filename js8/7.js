/*
 * Triplebyte 2:
 * Deletion distance between 2 strings is minimum sum of ASCII values
 * of characters that you need to delete in the 2 strings
 * in order to have the same string.
 *
 * Write a function to find deletion distance between 2 strings
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: 'cat', 'at'
 * Output: 99
 * Explanation: delete 'c' (ASCII value 99)
 *
 * Input: 'cat', 'bat'
 * Output: 197
 * Explanation: delete 'c' and 'b' (ASCII value 99 + 98)
 *
 * Input: 'boat', 'got'
 * Output: 298
 *
 * Input: 'thought', 'sloughs'
 * Output: 674
